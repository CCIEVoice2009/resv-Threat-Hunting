The Threat Hunter's Collection is a single PowerShell script that consolidates a diverse array of tools from open-source projects, creating a comprehensive toolkit for cyber threat hunters.

This collection aims to simplify the threat hunting process by providing a single point of access to various tools, eliminating the need for tedious setup, sourcing downloads, or complex commands.

The toolkit promotes portability, allowing hunters to be creativeâ€”whether on a USB drive, as an email template, or CURL it from a repository for convenient and efficient threat hunting on the go. Explore the tools, contribute to the project, and enhance your threat hunting capabilities with the Threat Hunter's Collection.
